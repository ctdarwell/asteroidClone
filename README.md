# asteroidClone
an attempt at proper programming

This is an Asteroids clone game I wrote to develop my programming skills. It runs on Python3 and was developed using the pyGame module and manual (www.pygame.org). I run it through the IDLE Python GUI (I think you will have to additionally install the NumPy package but pyGame and other packages should already be included). Just download all the files into one folder then run `asteroids.py` through the GUI. As the game progresses your gun fires more quickly and the numbers of asteroids increases. This program is released under the GNU General Public License v.3; as are the images which were taken from https://opengameart.org under the same agreement. You are free to do anything with the program other than beat my highest score.
