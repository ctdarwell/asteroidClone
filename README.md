# asteroidClone
an attempt at proper programming

This is an Asteroids clone game I wrote to develop my programming skills. It runs on Python3 using the pyGame module (www.pygame.org) from which I developed the program. I run it through the IDLE Python GUI (I think you will have to additionally install the NumPy package). This program is released under the GNU General Public License v.3; as are the images which were taken from https://opengameart.org under the same agreement. You are free to do anything with the program other than beat my highest score.
